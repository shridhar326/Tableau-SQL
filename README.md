# Employee data visualization using SQL and tableau.
## Created a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990 and the resultant table and required visuals are available in [Table 1](https://github.com/shridhar326/Tableau-SQL/tree/main/Table%201)
## Compared the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990 and the resultant table and required visuals are available in [Table 2](https://github.com/shridhar326/Tableau-SQL/tree/main/Table%202)
## Compared the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and added a filter allowing you to see that per each department and the resultant table and required visulas are available in [Table 3](https://github.com/shridhar326/Tableau-SQL/tree/main/Table%203)
## Created an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range and this range is defined by two values that the user can insert when calling the procedure and resultant table and required visulas are available in [Table 4](https://github.com/shridhar326/Tableau-SQL/tree/main/Table%204)
